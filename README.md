# Project Setup and Execution

To implement and run the SuperStore Spark application project, follow these step-by-step instructions:

## Prerequisites
1. **Apache Spark**: Ensure that Apache Spark is installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Apache Spark website](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
2. **MySQL Database**: Make sure you have a MySQL database installed and running. Create a database named `vegetable_db` and execute the provided SQL script to set up the required tables.

## Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

### Download Code
- Download the SuperStore Spark application code files.

### Set Configuration
1. Open the `SuperStore.scala` file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Scala and Spark.
2. Update the `user` and `pwd` variables in the `SuperStore` object with your MySQL username and password.

### Configure Spark
- Ensure that Spark is properly configured in the `SparkSession` creation in the `SuperStore` object in the code.
- Adjust the `master` and `appName` parameters as needed.

### Load CSV Files
1. Place the CSV files (`Item_category.csv`, `whole_sale.csv`, `loss_rate.csv`, `sales.csv`) in a directory accessible to your MySQL database.
2. Update the file paths in the SQL script to match the location of your CSV files.

### Execute SQL Script
- Run the SQL script provided in a MySQL client or command-line interface to create the `vegetable_db` database, define tables, and load data from CSV files.

### Run Spark Application
1. Execute the SuperStore Spark application code. This can be done using an IDE or by using the `spark-submit` command.
2. Run the main method in the `SuperStore` object to trigger the analyses and methodologies on the loaded data.

### Observations
- Examine the console output for results and insights generated by the SuperStore Spark application.

## Notes
- Ensure that all dependencies are satisfied, including Spark, MySQL, and proper file paths.
- Review the Spark documentation for any additional configuration requirements specific to your environment.

By following these instructions, you can set up, configure, and run the SuperStore Spark application, allowing you to analyze and derive insights from the provided sales data.
